# REPORT
During this internship I learnt about Data science and Machine learning using Python programming language.
###### Data Science:
Today most of the data is unstructured or semi-structured. Simple BI tools are not capable of processing this huge volume and variety of data. This is why we need more complex and advanced analytical tools and algorithms for processing, analyzing and drawing meaningful insights out of it.And that's why we need Data Sience.none the less it can be used in decision making as well as predictive analysis.
###### Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. <br/><br/>
During the internship I worked with python 3.6 on Jupyter notebook and got familiar with GitHub Platform.
###### Libraries used during the projects:
1.NumPy for numerical data <br/>
2.Matplotlib for plotting <br/>
3.Pandas for data analysis <br/>
4.sklearn for ML and statistical modelling <br/>
5.statsmodel <br/>
